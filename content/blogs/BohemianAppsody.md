# Bohemian Appsody — a song for Kubernetes

![Microphone](./resources/mic.jpeg)

How can you have an open source project without a theme tune? An anthem for collaborators to bond over at Karaoke bars; to sing to an audience of perplexed bystanders.

This was the challenge I was faced with, and naturally — given our project being named [Appsody](https://appsody.dev), I turned to Queen’s ‘[Bohemian Rhapsody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ9rUzIMcZQ)’. What follows below was a one night challenge, to see if I could ruin a classic song with a parody about application development and deploying to Kubernetes.

I’m not claiming it’s 100% true to a developer’s experience, or that everyone in the world is using WebSphere Network Deployment, the flow isn’t perfect, etc etc, but hey — it was fun to create, and I hope you enjoy it as well.

Please come check out our project, follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/appsodydev), and star our [GitHub](https://github.com/appsody) repos if you like what you see!

## Bohemian Appsody

Is this configured right?
Is this app fantasy?
Caught in a landslide,
Of node module dependencies.
Why’s it this size?
Is it Enterprise quality?

I’m just a lead dev, building on WAS ND.
But I’ve been learning Spring, using Node,
Might try Swift, might try Go.
Learning Kubernetes, never really mattered to me,
To me.

Kubelet, just killed a pod.
Health checks showed it in the red.
Issued SIGTERM, now it’s dead.
Kubelet, my app had just begun!
But now you’ve gone and thrown it all away.

Kubelet, oh oh.
I’ll add readiness next time.
If i’ve not learnt how by this time tomorrow,
Carry on, carry on, auto-restart shouldn’t matter…

Too late,
my boss has come.
Sends shivers down my spine,
Asks why the app’s never online?
Goodbye Kubernetes, they’re saying no.
Gotta clean up all the pods and start again.

Kubelet, oh oh.
They just don’t want to die.
Sometimes wish I never used Docker at all.

I see a little silhouetto of a plan
Appsody, Appsody, could make it all work for me
Documents and readmes, using this is easy, see -

GitHub repo, GitHub repo, 
GitHub repo, GitHub repo,
GitHub repo, brew install
Tutorial-all-all-all

I’m just a lead dev, nobody loves me.
She’s just a lead dev, with a package registry
Spare her this strife, let her use Appsody

Java’s there, so is Node, will you include Go?
At this stage no! We will not include Go (include Go!)
At this stage, we will not include Go (include Go!)
At this stage, we will not include Go (include Go!)
Will not include Go, (include Go!),
Maybe one day include Go, (include Go!),
One day include go

Oh oh no, no, no, no, no, no

Oh mama mia, mama mia,
Mama mia include Go!
Beelzebub, has the devil asked for PHP, PHP, PHP?

So you think you can help me with this CLI?
So you think I can wave all these troubles goodbye?
Oh baby, sounds pretty good to me baby.
Just gotta try out, just gotta try it out over here.

Oh oh oh yeah, oh oh yeah,

Cloud native really matters.
Anyone can see.
Cloud native apps made easy.
Cloud native apps made easy, for me.

Appsody’s new workflows….
