Appsody helps developers build containerized applications for the cloud that are ready to be deployed to Kubernetes without the user needing to be an expert on the underlying container technology.

The LoopBack team has recently contributed the [Node.js LoopBack stack](https://github.com/appsody/stacks/tree/master/incubator/nodejs-loopback) which extends the [Node.js stack](https://github.com/appsody/stacks/tree/master/incubator/nodejs) and provides a powerful solution to build open APIs and Microservices in TypeScript with [LoopBack](https://loopback.io), an open source Node.js API framework. It is based on [LoopBack 4](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next).

This tutorial is going to show you how to scaffold, run, stop, debug, and test a LoopBack 4 application in the Appsody development environment.

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this tutorial, you need to install the Appsody CLI, which also requires you to have Docker installed, along with a Node.js application to cloud package.

### Install the Appsody CLI

Follow the [Installing Appsody](https://appsody.dev/docs/getting-started/installation) guide to install the CLI for your platform.

### Scaffolding a LoopBack 4 Application using Appsody

Using the Appsody CLI, you can quickly scaffold a LoopBack 4 application.

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Create a directory named **appsodyLB4Todo**:

   ```
   mkdir appsodyLB4Todo
   ```

3. Navigate to that directory:

   ```
   cd appsodyLB4Todo
   ```

4. List the available Appsody stacks (and templates) with:

   ```
   appsody list
   ```

   You should see the
   [nodejs-loopback](https://github.com/appsody/stacks/tree/master/incubator/nodejs-loopback)
   stack (and template) listed:

   ```
   REPO            ID                              VERSION         TEMPLATES               DESCRIPTION

   ...
   *incubator      nodejs-loopback                 0.3.0           *scaffold               LoopBack 4 API Framework for Node.js
   ...
   ```

5. Scaffold a LoopBack 4 application in the current directory by using the `appsody init` command as follows:

   ```
   appsody init nodejs-loopback
   ```

   The output should look similar to the following:

   ```
   Checking stack requirements...
   Docker requirements met.
   Appsody requirements met.
   Running appsody init...
   Downloading nodejs-loopback template project from https://github.com/appsody/stacks/releases/download/nodejs-loopback-v0.3.0/incubator.nodejs-loopback.v0.3.0.templates.scaffold.tar.gz
   Download complete. Extracting files from /Users/helenmasters/appsodyLB4Todo/nodejs-loopback.tar.gz
   Setting up the development environment
   Your Appsody project name has been set to appsodylb4todo
   Pulling docker image docker.io/appsody/nodejs-loopback:0.3
   Running command: docker pull docker.io/appsody/nodejs-loopback:0.3
   0.3: Pulling from appsody/nodejs-loopback
   ...
   Status: Downloaded newer image for appsody/nodejs-loopback:0.3
   Running command: docker run --rm --entrypoint /bin/bash docker.io/appsody/nodejs-loopback:0.3 -c "find /project -type f -name .appsody-init.sh"
   Successfully initialized Appsody project with the nodejs-loopback stack and the default template.
   ```

   The most important lines to make note of are:

   ```
   Your Appsody project name has been set to appsodylb4todo

   and

   Successfully initialized Appsody project with the nodejs-loopback stack and the default template.
   ```

6. Install all the dependencies of this application with:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

7. Now that all the dependencies are installed, open this project in your favorite IDE.

   This tutorial is going to use VS Code:

   ```
   code .
   ```

8. The basic structure of the application looks like this:

   ![lb4appsody_template_files_1.png](./imgs/lb4appsody_template_files_1.png)

   One important file is the Appsody configuration file for your project, which is named
   `.appsody-config.yaml`. It defines the `name` of your project, and the stack on
   which it is based.

   ```yaml
   project-name: appsodylb4todo
   stack: appsody/nodejs-loopback:0.3
   ```

9. The source code for the LoopBack 4 application is located in the `src`
   directory.

   ![lb4appsody_template_files_2.png](./imgs/lb4appsody_template_files_2.png)

10. This basic application only defines one API endpoint `'/ping'` in the file
    `src/controllers/ping.controller.ts`

    The initial application is very similar to the one generated by the
    `'lb4 app'`
    [command](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Application-generator.html), but
    it's going to be a loaded by a facade that sets up health and metrics for cloud
    native observability.

In the next section, you are going to add more API endpoints.

## Building Your Application

The template application is only a starting point.

Now you are going to build a more realistic LoopBack 4 application.

You are going to use the `todo list` application from the
[Todo Tutorial](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/todo-tutorial.html) as an
example.

### Add the Todo model

To add the Todo model you need the `'lb4'` application generator installed.

#### Install the 'lb4' application generator

[Install the 'lb4' application generator](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Getting-started.html) by entering the following command:

```
npm i -g @loopback/cli
```
####  Create the `Todo` model

Create the `Todo` model using:

```
lb4 model
```

You are prompted with different questions. Specify the responses as follows:

```
? Model class name: todo
? Please select the model base class: Entity (A persisted m
odel with an ID)
? Allow additional (free-form) properties? No
Model Todo will be created in src/models/todo.model.ts

Let's add a property to Todo
Enter an empty property name when done

? Enter the property name: id
? Property type: number
? Is id the ID property? Yes
? Is id generated automatically? Yes

Let's add another property to Todo
Enter an empty property name when done

? Enter the property name: title
? Property type: string
? Is it required?: Yes
? Default value [leave blank for none]:

Let's add another property to Todo
Enter an empty property name when done

? Enter the property name: desc
? Property type: string
? Is it required?: No
? Default value [leave blank for none]:

Let's add another property to Todo
Enter an empty property name when done

? Enter the property name: isComplete
? Property type: boolean
? Is it required?: No
? Default value [leave blank for none]:

Let's add another property to Todo
Enter an empty property name when done
```

You are not going to add further properties, so just hit the ENTER key at this point. The output is then generated as follows:

```
? Enter the property name:
  create src/models/todo.model.ts
  update src/models/index.ts

Model Todo was created in src/models/
```

### Add a Datasource

1. Next, create a datasource for an in-memory database by using:

   ```
   lb4 datasource
   ```

   You are prompted with different questions. Specify the responses as follows:

   ```
   ? Datasource name: db
   ? Select the connector for db: In-memory db (supported by StrongLoop)
   ? window.localStorage key to use for persistence (browser only):
   ? Full path to file for persistence (server only): ./data/db.json
   create src/datasources/db.datasource.config.json
   create src/datasources/db.datasource.ts
   update src/datasources/index.ts

   Datasource Db was created in src/datasources/
   ```

2. Create a folder named: `/appsodyLB4Todo/data`
3. Create a file named: `/appsodyLB4Todo/data/db.json`
4. Place the following content inside `db.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "ids": {
       "Todo": 5
     },
     "models": {
       "Todo": {
         "1": "{\"title\":\"Take over the galaxy\",\"desc\":\"MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAMWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\",\"id\":1}",
         "2": "{\"title\":\"destroy alderaan\",\"desc\":\"Make sure there are no survivors left!\",\"id\":2}",
         "3": "{\"title\":\"play space invaders\",\"desc\":\"Become the very best!\",\"id\":3}",
         "4": "{\"title\":\"crush rebel scum\",\"desc\":\"Every.Last.One.\",\"id\":4}"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Add a Repository

Next, add a repository to handle the database CRUD functions of the `Todo` model by using:

```
lb4 repository
```

You are prompted with different questions. Specify the responses as follows:

```
? Please select the datasource: DbDatasource
? Select the model(s) you want to generate a repository: Todo
? Please select the repository base class: DefaultCrudRepository (Legacy juggler bridge)
   create src/repositories/todo.repository.ts
   update src/repositories/index.ts

Repository TodoRepository was created in src/repositories/
```

### Add a Controller

Now, create a controller to define and handle the request-response lifecycle
for our API endpoints by using:

```
lb4 controller
```

You are prompted with different questions. Specify the responses as follows:

```
? Controller class name: todo
Controller Todo will be created in src/controllers/todo.controller.ts

? What kind of controller would you like to generate? REST Controller with CRUD functions
? What is the name of the model to use with this CRUD repository? Todo
? What is the name of your CRUD repository? TodoRepository
? What is the name of ID property? id
? What is the type of your ID? number
? Is the id omitted when creating a new instance? Yes
? What is the base HTTP path name of the CRUD operations? /todos
   create src/controllers/todo.controller.ts
   update src/controllers/index.ts

Controller Todo was created in src/controllers/
```

Look inside `src/controllers/todo.controller.ts`, there are several more endpoints:

- GET / POST / PATCH `/todos`
- GET / PATCH / PUT / DEL `/todos/{id}`
- GET `/todos/count`

So, in total, these are the available endpoints of this application:

- Application endpoint: http://localhost:3000/
- API explorer: http://localhost:3000/explorer
- Open API Spec: http://localhost:3000/openapi.json
- API endpoints:
  - http://localhost:3000/ping
  - http://localhost:3000/todos
  - http://localhost:3000/todos/{id}
  - http://localhost:3000/todos/count
- Health endpoint: http://localhost:3000/health
- Liveness endpoint: http://localhost:3000/live
- Readiness endpoint: http://localhost:3000/ready
- Metrics endpoint: http://localhost:3000/metrics

### Using the Appsody run, test, and debug commands

At this point, your application has been fully enabled. This means that you can now run, test, and debug your application in the continuous containerized environment provided by the Appsody Stack. Once you have entered `appsody run` in the terminal and your Appsody local development environment is up and running you can check out the endpoints listed in the previous section.

For more information see the documentation for [Appsody local development](https://appsody.dev/docs/using-appsody/local-development).

If your application is currently running under Appsody, you can stop it with `Ctrl+C`, or by running the command `appsody stop` from another terminal.

 > To turn on debug tracing in a LoopBack 4 application running under the control of Appsody, you need to use the `--docker-options` parameter. You can specify this parameter for the run, debug and test commands: `appsody [run | debug | test] --docker-options "--env DEBUG=loopback*"`
