# Developing Stacks
Although there are many Appsody stacks to choose from, you might want to create an entirely new stack or alter some aspects of an existing stack to match your development needs or standards.

---

## Start developing a stack

### Create your own stack using the Appsody CLI

The quickest way to create a new stack is to use the `appsody stack create` command, which creates a new stack by copying an existing stack. By default, the new stack is based on the starter stack. For example, to create a new stack named my-stack, in a new directory, use this command:

```
appsody stack create my-stack
```

### Modify an existing stack using the Appsody CLI

If you want to use a different stack as the basis for your new stack, use the `--copy` flag to specify the stack that you want to use as the starting point. You can use `appsody list` to see the available stacks. For example, to create a new stack, called my-stack, based on the Node.js Express stack use this command:

```
appsody stack create my-stack --copy incubator/nodejs-express
```

---

## Define the stack behavior

The `stack.yaml` file in the top level directory defines the different attributes of the stack including the template that the stack should use by default.  The `stack.yaml` should be the first thing you define when developing your stack. See the following example:

```
name: Sample Application Stack        # concise one line name for the stack
version: 0.1.0                        # version of the stack
description: sample stack description # free form text explaining more about the capabilities of this stack and various templates
license: Apache-2.0                   # license for the stack
language: nodejs                      # programming language the stack uses
maintainers:                          # list of maintainer(s) details
  - name: John Smith
    email: example@example.com
    github-id: jsmith
default-template: my-template-1       # name of default template
```

## Define the stack image

The stack image contains common capabilities that can be used by all templates. For example, the [`nodejs-express`](https://github.com/appsody/stacks/tree/master/incubator/nodejs-express) stack image provides health endpoints and Prometheus metrics so that developers do not need to implement them.

### Stack environment variables

Stack creators configure [environment variables](/docs/stacks/environment-variables) in `Dockerfile-stack` to specify the commands for running, debugging, and testing the application. The Appsody controller inspects these environment variables and then drives the expected behavior for the developer during local development.

* **Handling File mounts** - During local development, the application code is held on the local file system and is mounted in the running container for the stack. Stack creators configure the [`APPSODY_MOUNTS`](/docs/stacks/environment-variables) enivronment variable to specify a list of mount paths to achieve this behavior.

* **Monitoring file changes** - Stack creators configure the many [`APPSODY_WATCH`](/docs/stacks/environment-variables) environment variables in `Dockerfile-stack` to specify which files are monitored for changes and how to reflect those changes in the running application.

* **Managing dependencies** - Appsody enables the caching of any installed dependencies across runs to accelerate local development. Caching is achieved by creating one or more volumes independent of a specific container instance and then mounting them every time the appsody container is started. Stack creators configure the [`APPSODY_DEPS`](/docs/stacks/environment-variables) environment variable to specify a list of the directories to be cached.

### File permissions

If you want to protect some of the files in your stack from being changed by a user, set file permissions accordingly. For example, one of your dependencies might be vital for security reasons and should not be modified.

> To preserve file permissions on Windows, you must include `RUN chmod` commands on specified files in your Dockerfile.

### IDE Considerations

Sometimes, a template might need dependencies or other assets that come from the stack image. In this case, include a script that can be called when the appsody init command is run to ensure that the user's local development environment is correctly configured. Otherwise, when a user starts developing in their IDE and the dependencies or assets are missing, the IDE reports multiple errors.

The following example is taken from the [Kitura](https://github.com/appsody/stacks/tree/master/incubator/kitura) stack:

```
#!/bin/bash
#
# Create local copy of package dependencies to enable building and code
# completion while developing locally.
#
set -e

# Current directory is .appsody-init, which is a child of the user's
# project directory, so we copy the dependencies to a .appsody directory
# one level up.
cp -R -p ./deps ../.appsody
```

In this example, dependencies exist in a folder called `deps` and are copied into the project directory with a `cp` command.

### License

You must provide a valid license when developing a stack, such as [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

## Create your project templates

When you create your stack, include a simple template to get users started, such as a "Hello World!". Each stack should specify a default template that is used to initialize a project when a template is not specified with the `appsody init` command. Specify your default template in the `stack.yaml` file. A stack can have multiple templates. Each template might represent a different class of starter application that uses the stack technology components.

If you include a capability that applies to all of your templates, consider including that capability in the stack image instead.

## Application build and deployment
Stack creators must provide a `Dockerfile` that defines how to build the container image for the Appsody application, including capabilities from the stack and the developer's application.

The Appsody CLI uses the `Dockerfile` to create the application container image when the [`appsody build`](/content/docs/cli-commands.md/#appsody-build) command is run.

Stack creators also provide a template deployment manifest file that the Appsody CLI uses to support deployments to Kubernetes or Knative platforms. This manifest file is `image/config/app-deploy.yaml`, which is used by the Appsody Operator.

## Next steps

Packaging allows a stack developer to build all the components of a stack and enables the stack to be used via Appsody CLI commands. The packaging process typically involves: building the stack container image, creating archive files for each template, and configuring a local Appsody repository. For more information, see [Packaging Stacks](/docs/stacks/package).

## Advanced Topics

### Stack variables

Often in a stack, there are common values that are used across the image and template. It can be laborious to manually go through a stack and make changes to the values in every place they occur, especially if they change frequently, such as the version number. Stack creators can declare values in their `stack.yaml` file and use variables to refer to them throughout the stack; values can be changed in one place and always remain in sync.

Variables are converted into their values before a stack is packaged. To use variables in your stack, wrap your stack variables with `{{.stack}}`.

**Example usage:**

```
This is {{.stack.name}}, running version: {{.stack.version}}.
```

> Do not use stack variables in a readme file.

#### Built-in stack variables

The variables that stack creators can use to access stack values are:

| Variable                  | Value                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.stack.id`               | The stack name from the stack path.                                                   |
| `.stack.name`             | The `name` value from `stack.yaml`.                                                   |
| `.stack.description`      | The `description` value from `stack.yaml`.                                            |
| `.stack.created`          | The `timestamp` of when the stack was packaged.                                       |
| `.stack.tag`              | The `tag` value from Docker image.                                                    |
| `.stack.maintainers`      | The `maintainers` list from `stack.yaml`.                                             |
| `.stack.version`          | The `version` value from `stack.yaml`.                                                |
| `.stack.semver.major`     | The `version` major value from `stack.yaml`.                                          |
| `.stack.semver.minor`     | The `version` minor value from `stack.yaml`.                                          |
| `.stack.semver.patch`     | The `version` patch value from `stack.yaml`.                                          |
| `.stack.semver.majorminor`| The `version` major and minor values from `stack.yaml`.                               |
| `.stack.image.namespace`  | The `image-namespace` from user defined image-namespace flag, default is `dev.local`. |

#### Custom stack variables

If you want to use your own custom variables, you can declare a `templating-data` map in your `stack.yaml`. This map can contain only `key`: `value` pairs.

```
templating-data:
  variable1: value1
  variable2: value2
  variable3: value3
```

**Example usage:**

```
This is {{.stack.variable1}}, this is {{.stack.variable2}} and this is {{.stack.variable3}}.
```

> Custom variables must begin with an alphanumeric character.

### Setting stack requirements

You might modify a stack to restrict a user to a specific version, or range of versions, for a given technology. With the Appsody CLI, you can enforce version restrictions only when using Docker, [Buildah](https://buildah.io/), and the Appsody CLI.

To set a requirement, use the following format in the `stack.yaml`:
```
name: <stack-name>
version: 0.1.0
.
.
.
requirements:
   docker-version: ">= 17.09.0"
   appsody-version: "0.2.7 - 0.4.10"
   buildah-version: "<= 1.10.0"
```

For a full list of version comparisons that the CLI supports, see [SemVer: Basic Comparisons](https://github.com/Masterminds/semver#basic-comparisons).

When a project that uses the stack is initialized, the CLI checks whether the user meets the stack requirements. If the requirements are not met, the user cannot use the stack.
