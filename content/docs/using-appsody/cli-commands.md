## appsody build

Build a local container image of your Appsody project.

### Synopsis

Build a local container image of your Appsody project. The stack, along with your Appsody project, is extracted to a local directory before the container build is run.

By default, the built image is tagged with the project name that you specified when you initialised your Appsody project. If you did not specify a name, the image is tagged with the name of the root directory of your Appsody project.

If you want to push the built image to an image repository using the [--push] options, you must specify the relevant image tag.

Run this command from the root directory of your Appsody project.

```
appsody build [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  appsody build -t my-repo/nodejs-express --push
  Builds the container image, tags it with my-repo/nodejs-express, and pushes it to the container registry the Docker CLI is currently logged into.

  appsody build -t my-repo/nodejs-express:0.1 --push-url my-registry-url
  Builds the container image, tags it with my-repo/nodejs-express, and pushes it to my-registry-url/my-repo/nodejs-express:0.1.
```

## appsody deploy

Build and deploy your Appsody project to Kubernetes.

### Synopsis

Build and deploy a local container image of your Appsody project to your Kubernetes cluster. 
		
The command performs the following steps:

1. Runs the appsody build command to build the container image for deployment.
2. Generates a deployment manifest file, "app-deploy.yaml", if one is not present, then applies it to your Kubernetes cluster.
3. Deploys your image to your Kubernetes cluster via the Appsody operator, or as a Knative service if you specify the "--knative" flag. If an Appsody operator cannot be found, one will be installed on your cluster.

Run this command from the root directory of your Appsody project.

```
appsody deploy [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  appsody deploy --namespace my-namespace
  Builds and deploys your project to the "my-namespace" namespace in your local Kubernetes cluster.
  
  appsody deploy -t my-repo/nodejs-express --push-url external-registry-url --pull-url internal-registry-url
  Builds and tags the image as "my-repo/nodejs-express", pushes the image to "external-registry-url/my-repo/nodejs-express", and creates a deployment manifest that tells the Kubernetes cluster to pull the image from "internal-registry-url/my-repo/nodejs-express".

## appsody init

Initialize an Appsody project.

### Synopsis

Set up the local Appsody development environment. You can do this for an existing project or use the template application provided by the stack. 

By default, the command creates an Appsody stack configuration file and provides a simple default application. You can also initialize a project with a different template application, or no template. 

To initialize a project with a template application, in a directory that is not empty, you need to specify the "overwrite" option [--overwrite].
Use 'appsody list' to see the available stacks and templates.

```
appsody init [stack] or [repository]/[stack] [template] [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  appsody init nodejs-express
  Initializes a project with the default template from the "nodejs-express" stack in the default repository.
  
  appsody init experimental/nodejs-functions
  Initializes a project with the default template from the "nodejs-functions" stack in the "experimental" repository.
  
  appsody init nodejs-express scaffold
  Initializes a project with the "scaffold" template from "nodejs-express" stack in the default repository.

  appsody init nodejs none
  Initializes a project without a template for the "nodejs" stack in the default repository.

  appsody init
  Runs the stack init script to set up the local development environment on an existing Appsody project.
```

### Options

      --no-template             Only create the .appsody-config.yaml file. Do not unzip the template project. [Deprecated]
      --overwrite               Download and extract the template project, overwriting existing files.  This option is not intended to be used in Appsody project directories.
      --project-name string     Project Name for Kubernetes Service (default "my-project")
      --stack-registry string   Specify the URL of the registry that hosts your stack images.
