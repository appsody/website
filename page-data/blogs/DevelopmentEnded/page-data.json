It has had almost 100 contributors, has had over 1.1 million downloads, and supports over 20 different technologies, spanning Java, Node.js, Python, Rust, Swift and Go.</p>\n<p>We weren’t alone in these efforts. Part of the appeal with Kubernetes is the extensive ecosystem which has grown and evolved around it, including projects looking to abstract some of the complexities away from the developer experience. This is always great and exciting to see, but can again add further complexity of choice for those looking to build applications. Therefore over the last 6 months we have been working to combine  our efforts with the Odo project, merging the technologies from Appsody with odo to create odo 2.0. We've taken the concept of Stacks which we introduced in Appsody, to evolve standards like devfiles v2 for wider consumption and adoption.</p>\n<p>Odo 2.0 brings the best of each technology and provides \"a fast, iterative, and straightforward CLI tool for developers who write, build, and deploy applications on Kubernetes and OpenShift\".</p>\n<p>As such, development of Appsody as a standalone project is ending, but the mission continues in odo 2.0.
