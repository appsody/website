It might seem odd that there are any requirements on the stack for initialization, but since the goal is for the stack image to encapsulate <em>all</em> aspects of the stack, the configuration steps required (which are likely to be technology specific) are indeed contained within it. The following is a summary of what happens during initialization:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Appsody CLI finds the yaml entry for the stack in the respective repo</li>\n<li>Appsody CLI downloads the referenced tar file for the specified template to be used as a basis for the user application, and extracts the contents. This creates the directory structure within the current directory, including the <code>.appsody-config.yaml</code> file that specifies the stack image itself (which is usually stored in a Docker repository)</li>\n<li>Appsody CLI downloads this stack image</li>\n<li>Appsody CLI inspects the stack image to see if it has an initialization file within it called <code>appsody-init.sh</code> (or <code>appsody-init.bat</code> if running on Windows). If this file exists, it is executed to set up any further configuration. Note that it not recommended that this initialization installs new packages or modules in user space of the local machine. Any dependencies should be handled by ensuring this happens during run and build, listed below.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"local-development\"><a href=\"#local-development\" aria-label=\"local development permalink\" class=\"header-link-icon\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Local Development</h2>\n<p>During local development, when the stack image is run, it must build the appropriate local container runtime configuration.

The primary use of this is to mount the directory holding the user application into the container, so that the appsody-controller can have access to your application (and run it inside the container). For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">ENV APPSODY_MOUNTS=.:/project/userapp\n</code></pre>\n<p>   would map the current directory (where the init was performed), into <code>/project/userapp</code> in the container file system.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can specify only directories in volume mounts, not single files.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p>Dependency directory volumes<br>\nVolumes are created that are used to cache, for efficiency, the combined dependencies of the stack components and the user application between sequential runs of the application during local development. The volumes are not mounted into the user directory, since access to that directory is not required outside of the Docker environment. The volumes to be created are specified by the Docker variable APPSODY_DEPS. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">ENV APPSODY_DEPS=/project/deps\n</code></pre>\n<p>   would cause the creation of a volume that is mounted into the container file systems at <code>/project/deps</code>.</p>\n<p>   Multiple dependency directory volumes can be specified by separating the mount path with a semicolon.  For example: </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">ENV APPSODY_DEPS=/project/deps;/project/test/deps\n</code></pre>\n<p>   would cause the creation of two volumes that are mounted into the container file systems at <code>/project/deps</code> and <code>/project/test/deps</code>.   </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Appsody controller mount<br>\nThe Appsody CLI automatically creates the Appsody controller mount, as it knows which version of the controller needs to be used.  When you run the <code>appsody run</code>, <code>appsody debug</code>, or <code>appsody test</code> commands, the Appsody CLI creates a Docker volume, if it doesn't exist, named <code>appsody-controller-&#x3C;version></code>, and installs appropriate Appsody controller, as indicated by <code>&#x3C;version></code>. The volume is then mounted at <code>/.appsody</code> in the container file system.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As the Appsody CLI is responsible for installing the appropriate version of the Appsody controller, the stack developer doesn't need to be aware of the Appsody controller version.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enabling-the-software-dependencies\"><a href=\"#enabling-the-software-dependencies\" aria-label=\"enabling the software dependencies permalink\" class=\"header-link-icon\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Enabling the software dependencies</h3>\n<p>There are two types of dependencies that need to be handled by the stack.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Dependencies required for the technology components included in the stack<br>\nFor efficiency, these only need to be installed when the image is launched. Hence, these are typically encoded as regular Docker commands. For example, in the python-flask stack, these dependencies are defined in a <code>Pipfile</code> in the <code>image/project</code> directory, and are processed by the following Docker commands:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">RUN pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt\nRUN python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -t /project/deps\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dependencies added by the developer for their application<br>\nSince the developer might add these at any stage, these are generated each time an Appsody command is executed by the controller. This is achieved by setting the <code>ENV APPSODY_PREP</code> Docker variable, which the Appsody controller will execute. For example, again in the python-flask stack, these dependencies are defined in the user directory (created by the template) and are referenced by:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">ENV APPSODY_PREP=\"cd /project/userapp; pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt; python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -t /project/deps\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>   [Note that in older stacks this variable was called <code>APPSODY_INSTALL</code>, which has since been deprecated]</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"setting-up-any-environment-variables-required\"><a href=\"#setting-up-any-environment-variables-required\" aria-label=\"setting up any environment variables required permalink\" class=\"header-link-icon\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Setting up any environment variables required</h3>\n<p>Any environment variables required by the technology in the stack itself are typically set in the <code>Dockerfile-stack</code> file, using the regular Docker <code>ENV</code> command.</p>\n<h3 id=\"passing-control-to-the-appsody-controller-to-run-the-user-application\"><a href=\"#passing-control-to-the-appsody-controller-to-run-the-user-application\" aria-label=\"passing control to the appsody controller to run the user application permalink\" class=\"header-link-icon\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Passing control to the Appsody controller to run the user application</h3>\n<p>When an <code>appsody run</code> command is issued, the stack image is launched in the local Docker environment of the user machine and the appsody-controller is set as the entrypoint.
