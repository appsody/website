As such, a stack is designed to support two ways of working:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Local Development</strong><br>\nDuring local development, the stack provides everything to enable the development of a new application on the local machine, with the application <em>always</em> being run in a (local) containerized Docker environment. The fact that application development uses containerization from the start (as opposed to development solely in the user space of the local machine) minimizes the chances of introducing subtle issues in the containerization process, and removes the need for a developer to install the core technology components that will underpin their application. Therefore, the requirements on the stack are to have all the dependencies for the particular technologies involved pre-built into the Docker image, and also to dynamically compliment these with whatever dependencies are added explicitly by the developer for their code. Local development consists of the Appsody CLI (hooked into a local IDE if required), communicating with a local Docker container that is running the application under development. Furthermore, local development is accelerated by enabling application code to be held on the local file system, whilst being mounted in the Docker container, so that a local change can automatically trigger a restart of the application.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Build and Deploy</strong><br>\nDuring build and deploy, the stack enables the Appsody CLI to build a self-contained Docker image that includes both the core technologies in the stack plus the application code that has been developed, along with the combined dependencies of both. The resulting image can then be deployed manually or programmatically to any platform that supports Docker images (such as a local or public Kubernetes cluster).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"stack-structure\"><a href=\"#stack-structure\" aria-label=\"stack structure permalink\" class=\"header-link-icon\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Stack structure</h2>\n<p>A stack is designed to support both ways of working; local development, and build and deploy. Therefore, all stacks follow the same structure, which is shown here:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">my-stack\n├── README.md\n├── stack.yaml\n├── image/\n|   ├── config/\n|   |   └── app-deploy.yaml\n|   ├── project/\n|   |   ├── [files that provide the technology components of the stack]\n|   |   └── Dockerfile\n│   ├── Dockerfile-stack\n|   └── LICENSE\n└── templates/\n    ├── my-template-1/\n    |       └── [example files as a starter for the application, e.g. \"hello world\"]\n    └── my-template-2/\n            └── [example files as a starter for a more complex application]\n</code></pre>\n<p>The stack structure is processed when you build a stack, to generate a Docker image for the stack, along with tar files of each of the templates, which can then all be stored/referenced in a local or public Appsody repository. Refer to the section on <a href=\"/content/docs/stacks/package.md\">Packaging Stacks</a> for more details. The Appsody CLI can then access such a repo, to use the stack to initiate local development.</p>\n<p>As described earlier, the stack (along with the Appsody software) has different responsibilities, depending whether you are in local development, or build and deploy. To understand how the stack operates, we will delve into each of these scenarios separately, including the initial work that is required to initialize the project. One of things that can initially cause confusion when looking at the source of an Appsody stack is that there are two Dockerfiles. The Dockerfiles are independent of each other - one is used to build the initial stack image (<code>Dockerfile-stack</code>) and one to build the final application image (<code>Dockerfile</code>). These are both described as we examine the scenarios.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stack-requirements-during-initialization\"><a href=\"#stack-requirements-during-initialization\" aria-label=\"stack requirements during initialization permalink\" class=\"header-link-icon\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Stack requirements during initialization</h2>\n<p>Initialization occurs when a user issues an <code>appsody init</code> command in a new empty directory, in order to configure a new project. It might seem odd that there are any requirements on the stack for initialization, but since the goal is for the stack image to encapsulate <em>all</em> aspects of the stack, the configuration steps required (which are likely to be technology specific) are indeed contained within it. The following is a summary of what happens during initialization:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Appsody CLI finds the yaml entry for the stack in the respective repo</li>\n<li>Appsody CLI downloads the referenced tar file for the specified template to be used as a basis for the user application, and extracts the contents. This creates the directory structure within the current directory, including the <code>.appsody-config.yaml</code> file that specifies the stack image itself (which is usually stored in a Docker repository)</li>\n<li>Appsody CLI downloads this stack image</li>\n<li>Appsody CLI inspects the stack image to see if it has an initialization file within it called <code>appsody-init.sh</code> (or <code>appsody-init.bat</code> if running on Windows). If this file does it exist, it is executed to set up any further configuration. Note that it not recommended that this initialization installs new packages or modules in user space of the local machine. Any dependencies should be handled by ensuring this happens during run and build, listed below.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"stack-operation-during-local-development\"><a href=\"#stack-operation-during-local-development\" aria-label=\"stack operation during local development permalink\" class=\"header-link-icon\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Stack operation during local development</h2>\n<p>During local development, when the stack image is run, it must build the appropriate local container runtime configuration.

The primary use of this is to mount the directory holding the user application into the container, so that the appsody-controller can have access to your application (and run it inside the container). For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">ENV APPSODY_MOUNTS=/:/project/userapp\n</code></pre>\n<p>   would map the current directory (where the init was performed), into <code>/project/userapp</code> in the container file system.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dependency directory volume<br>\nThis creates a volume used to cache, for efficiency, the combined dependencies of the stack components and the user application between sequential runs of the application during local development. It is not mounted into the user directory, since access to this is not required outside of the Docker environment. This is specified via the Docker variable <code>APPSODY_DEPS</code>. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">ENV APPSODY_DEPS=/project/deps\n</code></pre>\n<p>   would cause the creation of a volume to be created and mounted into the container file systems at <code>/project/deps</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Appsody controller mount<br>\nThe Appsody CLI automatically creates the Appsody controller mount, as it knows which version of the controller needs to be used.  When you run the <code>appsody run</code>, <code>appsody debug</code>, or <code>appsody test</code> commands, the Appsody CLI creates a Docker volume, if it doesn't exist, named <code>appsody-controller-&#x3C;version></code>, and installs appropriate Appsody controller, as indicated by <code>&#x3C;version></code>. The volume is then mounted at <code>/.appsody</code> in the container file system. </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As the Appsody CLI is responsible for installing the appropriate version of the Appsody controller, the stack developer doesn't need to be aware of the Appsody controller version.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enabling-the-software-dependencies\"><a href=\"#enabling-the-software-dependencies\" aria-label=\"enabling the software dependencies permalink\" class=\"header-link-icon\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Enabling the software dependencies</h3>\n<p>There are two types of dependencies that need to be handled by the stack.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Dependencies required for the technology components included in the stack<br>\nFor efficiency, these only need to be installed when the image is launched. Hence, these are typically encoded as regular Docker commands. For example, in the python-flask stack, these dependencies are defined in a <code>Pipfile</code> in the <code>image/project</code> directory, and are processed by the following Docker commands:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">RUN pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt\nRUN python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -t /project/deps\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dependencies added by the developer for their application<br>\nSince the developer might add these at any stage, these are generated each time an Appsody command is executed by the controller. This is achieved by setting the <code>ENV APPSODY_PREP</code> Docker variable, which the Appsody controller will execute.
